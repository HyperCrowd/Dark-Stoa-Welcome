						<p>You are here after having endured over twenty hours of Dark Stoa presentations, a few hours of old school internet chatroom antics, and the occasional edgy meme.  And you're still here.  Let's just take that as a sign that the world is probably not in a good place.</p>

						<p>We've been waiting for you.  Welcome to Season 4 of the Dark Stoa.  Here's what you should brush up on before you continue:</p>

						<h2>From Season 3 to Season 4</h2>
						<p>
							Season 3 was an experiment.  Those who watched all of Season 1 and 2 were able to join a Mattermost server if they found the link to it.  In this experiment, everyone came from random walks of life and had the ability to ban everyone.  There was no way I could prevent that banning.  After a year of organic discussion about Dark Stoa-related topics, <strong>not a single person used the ban option.</strong>  The results were obvious: <em>Dark Stoa Seasons 1 and 2 acts as a trust filter.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							Season 4 starts with the survivors of Season 3.  They will be empowered with tools and techniques to establish overwatch and influence random domains of interest.  Each domain will autobalance to the shortcomings of another domain based on a few math equations I've developed.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your task, humble newbie, is to find a way into those domains.  We still start you off with the following channels:
